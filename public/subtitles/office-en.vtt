Pam Cosso!

3
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.850
Sorry I'm late. I had to race across town. 

4
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.970
[Pam:] Oh, Michael..

5
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.740
[Michael:] Wow!

6
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.450
You did these freehand?

7
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.750
Yep.

8
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.340
My god. These could be tracings.

9
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.220
Oh, look at this line.

10
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.690
Wow.

11
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.750
You nailed it.

12
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.640
How much?

13
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.660
What do you mean?

14
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.620
I don't see a price.

15
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.430
Umm..

16
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:52.800
,you wanna buy it?

17
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.250
Well, yeah.

18
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.980
Yeah. We have to have it for the office.

19
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.400
I mean, there's my window

20
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.150
and there's my car.

21
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.890
Is that your car?

22
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.510
Uhhuh.

23
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.900
That is our building

24
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.220
and we sell paper.

24
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.270
I'm really proud of you.


25
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.510
Thank you.

26
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.470
[Pam:] Do you have something in your pocket?

27
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:049.240
Chunky.

28
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.050
Do I have

29
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.430
No thank you.

30
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.130
It is a message.

31
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.080
It is an inspiration.

32
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.310
It is a source of beauty,

33
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.770
and without paper it could not have happened

34
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.900
unless you had a camera.
