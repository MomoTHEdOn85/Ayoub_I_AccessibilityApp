## About  

The goal of this project is to create an accessible web application for video and audio content using Node.js and Express.js. To ensure accessibility, Il followed best practices for web accessibility and incorporated resources from Mozilla Accessibility notes. Additionally, I added closed captions for the video and transcripts for both the audio and video content.
